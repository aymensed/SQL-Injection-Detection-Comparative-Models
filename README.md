# SQL Injection Detection Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning

This repository contains the implementation and report of my Master's thesis in Data Engineering and Web Technologies at the University Ferhat Abbas - SÃ©tif 1.

## ðŸ§  Overview
The goal of this project is to detect SQL Injection attacks using both classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.  
The implemented models include:
- Logistic Regression (LR)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- BERT (Transformer-based model)
